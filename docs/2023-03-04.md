TS

If a function returns `void` it returns something that is `undefined`. 
On the other hand if a function throws an exception the return type of this function would be `never`. Never returning functions are not causing return type errors when called from a higher order functions.

Tuples are like arrays but with a custom structure
`const mytTuple: (boolean, number, string) = [true, 40, "words"]`
Tuples are immutable.
