It is good thing to name variable in a descriptive manner. 
Makes code human readable and helps to understand what does this code do.

Statements and expressions are sentences of python language. 

Equals sign `=` is an assignment symbol. It is used to write assignment statement.
In the assignment statement the part on the right of `=` will be evaluated first, and only then the result will be assigned to the variable on the left.

Operator precedence rules:
Parentheses
Power (Exponentiation)
Multiplication, Division and Remainder
Addition and Subtraction
Left to right

Even though python is dynamically typed language, you have to convert types.

Integer division always produces float in Python3.
