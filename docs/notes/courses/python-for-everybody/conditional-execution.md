If statement
```python
if x > 2 :
    print("X is greater than 2")
elif x == 2 :
	print("X is equal to 2")
else :
	print("X is less than 2")
```

For statement
```python
for i in range(5):
	print("Current value of i: " + str(i))
```

Conditional statements could be nested within each other.

Try block
```python
try:
	#some code to try if it fails
except:
	#code in case of exception
```
