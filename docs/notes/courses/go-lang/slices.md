A slice is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.
```go
a := make([]int, 3) // Int slice of length 3, zero-valued [0, 0, 0]
b := make([]int, 3, 5) // Int slice of length 3 and capacity 5
a[0] = 1 // Setting and getting are the same as for an array [1, 0, 0]
a = append(a, 1, 2) // [1, 0, 0, 1, 2]
```
Slices are half-open, first element is included, last - excluded.
```go
primes := [6]int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
var s []int = primes[1:4] // Elements from 1 to 3
```
Slices are views on an underlying array. It doesn't contain any data. Modifying values will modify them in the underlying array.
```go
// This will create an array
[3]bool{true, false, true}
//This will create the same array and then build a slice that references it
[]bool{true, false, true}
```
Slices can contain structs
```go
s := []struct {
		i int
		b bool
	}{
		{2, true},
		{3, false},
		{5, true},
		{7, true},
		{11, false},
		{13, true},
	}
```
Slices a populated with default values if nothing provided. These expressions are equivalent:
```go
a[0:10]
a[:10]
a[0:]
a[:]
```
Slices contain both length and capacity. Length - is the number of elements it contains. And capacity - is the number of elements in the underlying array.
```go
	s := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
	a := s[0:1]
	len(a) // Slice length
	cap(a) // Slice capacity
```
There are also nil slices
```go
var s []int // Nil slice
```
