Type `null` represents a missing value. It's a subtype of any other type except `undefined`. 

Ts config does strict null checks so `null` can't be assigned to a variable of some type. However this check might be disabled. To do that you need to set `strictNullChecks` to `false`.

There is a similar behavior with the `undefined`.
