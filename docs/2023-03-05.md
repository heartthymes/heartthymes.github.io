### 2 Variables, expressions and statements

It is good thing to name variable in a descriptive manner. 
Makes code human readable and helps to understand what does this code do.

Statements and expressions are sentences of python language. 

Equals sign `=` is an assignment symbol. It is used to write assignment statement.
In the assignment statement the part on the right of `=` will be evaluated first, and only then the result will be assigned to the variable on the left.

Operator precedence rules:
Parentheses
Power (Exponentiation)
Multiplication, Division and Remainder
Addition and Subtraction
Left to right

Even though python is dynamically typed language, you have to convert types.

Integer division always produces float in Python3.

### 3 Conditional execution
If statement
```python
if x > 2 :
    print("X is greater than 2")
elif x == 2 :
	print("X is equal to 2")
else :
	print("X is less than 2")
```

For statement
```python
for i in range(5):
	print("Current value of i: " + str(i))
```

Conditional statements could be nested within each other.

Try block
```python
try:
	#some code to try if it fails
except:
	#code in case of exception
```

### 4 Functions

Reusable parts of a code. Encapsulates data inside.
There are predefined reserved functions in python. 
Some of them are placed in libraries.

Definition of a function
```python
def thing():
	print("Thing!")
```

### 5 Loops and iteration

While loop  
```python
while x > 0:
	#statements
	break #exits the loop
	continue #skips current iteration and proceeds to the next one
```

For loop
```python
for i in range(5):
	#statements

for i in ["one", "two"]:
	#statements
```

None is a type! Representing nothing.
```python
if x is None:
	
```

### 6 Strings

```python
len("hello") #length of the string (?)
```

```python
name = "Vasya"
f"Hello {name}"
```

```python
dir(obj) #returns a list of methods of provided object
```

```python
"hello world"[:3] #a slice from the beginning of the string to index 3-1
```

```python
line = "Some text"
line.lstrip() #left trim
line.rstrip() #right trim
line.strip() #trim
```

```python
line = "Some text"
line.startswith('S') #true
```

### 7 Files
```python
fhand = open('mbox.txt')      #opens a file
for line in fhand:            #iterating through lines
	line = line.rstrip()      #removing \n symbol
	if not "test" in line:    #looks for "test" in each line
		continue
```

### 8 Lists
Lists are mutable
You can concatenate lists
You can slice lists
```python
my_list = list()
my_list.append("a")
my_list.append(1)
my_list.append([1, 2])

for i in range(len(my_list)):
	#will iterate through the whole list, i becomes equal to the current index

my_list.sort()  # sorts the list in descending orde
len(my_list)    # returns the length of the list
max(my_list)    # looks for maximum value element int the list
min(my_list)    # looks for minimum value element in the list
sum(my_list)    # summs all values in the list
my_list.split() # splist a string by a character (if provided) and returning a list
# by default split() uses space as a character
# split treats spaces as single space

```

### 9 Dictionaries
Dictionaries are key value pair collections

```python
my_dictionary = dict()            # declare dictionary
my_dictionaty['name'] = "Vasya"   # setting a value to a key
new_dictionary = { }              # declare an empty dictionary

my_dictionary.get('name', 0) + 1  # gets value by key 'name' or sets it to 0

for k, v in my_dictionary.items():             # returns a list of key value pair.
#it is possible to use both variables of an item
```
